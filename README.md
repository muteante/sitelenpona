# Writing New Content

Use this template when adding new bilingual content two-column content:

```
{% splith %}
    {% en %}English H2{% enden %}
    {% sp %}SP H2{% endsp %}
{% endsplith %}

{% split %}
{% en %}
English Content
{% enden %}

{% sp %}
SP Content
{% sp %}
```

`{% splith %}` and `{% split %}` and `{% sp %}` and `{% en %}` are [custom paired shortcodes](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/shortcodes/#paired-shortcodes) that are set up in eleventy.config.js. they expand into html right before the converstion from Markdown to HTML happens, so you can use Markdown content within the shortcodes. 

## Note: 
- `{% splith %}` and  `{% split %}` are different! `{% splith %}` (with the h) expands into a heading. use `{% split %}` on body text. 

- `{% splith %}` heading level defaults to h2. If you do `{% splith 3 %}`, you get an h3, etc. 




# Editing Templates

See [_includes/_layouts/page.html](/_includes/_layouts/page.html) for the site's main boilerplate. Modifying this will apply changes site-wide. 



# Hosting Information

The site is set up to run using GitHub Actions:

If running via GitHub pages, go into the repository Settings>Pages.
- Look for 'Build and deployment'. 
- Under 'Source' switch from 'Deploy from Branch' to 'GitHub Actions.' 

You have now told GitHub that you want to use actions. Time to tell it which one to use.
- On the main view, navigate to the 'Actions' tab. 
- Select 'All workflows.' 
- Select 'Deploy 11ty to GitHub Pages.' 

That should be enough to get it going. 

If assets fail to load, you might need to rename the path prefix. See .github/workflows/11ty-gh-pages.yml, find where it says this:

```
run: |
    npm install
    npx @11ty/eleventy --pathprefix=sitelenpona
```

change 'sitelenpona' to whatever you need. do not use slashes like --pathprefix=/sitelenpona/.
